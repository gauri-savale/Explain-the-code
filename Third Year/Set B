Q2. Detecting Negative Cycle (Bellman-Ford snippet explanation)
edges = [(0,1,1),(1,2,1),(2,0,
-3)]
V = 3
dist = [float('inf')]*V
dist[0] = 0
for _ in range(V-1):
for u,v,w in edges:
if dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
dist[v] = dist[u] + w
# check
has_cycle = any(dist[u] + w < dist[v] for u,v,w in edges)
print(has_cycle)
Task: Explain why this detects negative cycles and what prints.
